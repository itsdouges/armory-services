## Usage

### Quick start

tl;dr -> develop with `npm run tdd` and `npm run tdd:int`, use `npm run dev` to run local environment.

#### User image uploads

To have image uploads working locally you'll need a valid aws key/secret pair. Run it like so:

```
IMAGE_UPLOAD_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ACCESSKEYHERE IMAGE_UPLOAD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SECRETKEYHERE npm run dev
```

#### Email notifications

To have email notification working locally you'll need a valid aws key/secret pair. Run it like so:

```
SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ACCESSKEYHERE SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SECRETKEYHERE npm run dev
```

### Database migrations

Ensure any database migration is backwards compatible with a previous version of the api. This will keep deployments simple and clean.

```
ENV={ENV} npm run migrate
```
